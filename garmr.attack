Feature: Run a Garmr scan on a single URL

Scenario: Use Garmr to scan a website for basic security requirements
  Given "garmr" is installed
  And the following profile:
    | name       | value                              |
    | target_url | http://35.231.209.76:8080/hello-1.0/              |
  When I launch a "garmr" attack with:
    """
    garmr -u <target_url> -o my_garmr_output.xml
    """
#  Then the file "my_garmr_output.xml" should not contain XML:
#    | css                                            |
#    | testcase[name="SomethingYouCareAbout"] failure |
#
#  You have to use css in the table to use the XML parsing step
#
#  Files are written out to ./tmp/aruba and you should can see the file my_garmr_output.xml
